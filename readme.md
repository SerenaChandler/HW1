# Homework Assignment 1

## Languages used
- HTML - Used to write out the main code for the website
- CSS - Used to add different effects to the text and images in the HTML

## summary of the assignment
We were given the task of refactoring a website home page. Very few of the changes I made effected the way the page looked, most of the work went into organzing the code, 
and making it easier to read.
